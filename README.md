# Books Catalog

This is a program designed to store a database of book information for books owned by the user. Further, it uses the Google Books API to make entry/retreival of book details easier, as opposed to searching/entering the relevant information by hand. This project is still in progress.

If you want to run the project, download the contents of /src and run gui.py.

To browse the documentation to get an idea of the functions and modules used for the program logic, visit the GitHub Pages for this repo [here](https://cbrewer97.github.io/books-catalog/build/html/index.html). It is probably easiest to browse using the Modules Index page.
